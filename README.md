## Intro

This was the final project on the WDI course, the first one using React to create a MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React & Node.js) stack app.

## Build Process 

After being assigned the group we decided to spend some time thinking about ideas individually, then having a group discussion about each of our top three picks. We quickly came to an agreement that the app would be a travel app, showcasing 'hidden gems' around the world. As a group of three Londoners it was clear the app should be focused primarily in London to start, with the possibility of adding more cities later.




## Issues

  * We spent too much time thoroughly researching possible API's to implement, many of which we didn't end up using and therefore could have been more productive in the allocation of time for the final product.  
  
  * This was the first collaborative project for all three members of my group, leading to some issues at the beginning of the build process with merges on GitHub.
